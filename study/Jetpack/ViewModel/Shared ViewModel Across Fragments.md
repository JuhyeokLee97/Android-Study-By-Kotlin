# [Android] Shared ViewModel in Kotlin

## 개요
### Shared ViewModel

<p>

In android, we can use **ViewModel** to share data between various fragments or activities by sharing the same ViewModel among all the fragments and they can access everything defined in the ViewModel. This is one way to have communication between fragments or activities. Almost every application has some communication between various activities or fragments.
