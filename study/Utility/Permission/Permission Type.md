## Runtime Permissions
Runtime permissions, also known as dangerous permissions, give your app additional access to restricted data or let your app perform restricted actions that more substantially affect the system and other apps. Therefore, you need to request runtime permissions in your app before you can access the restricted data or perform restricted actions. Don't assume that these permissions have been previously grantedâ€”check them and, if needed, request them before each access.

When your app requests a runtime permission, the system presents a runtime permission prompt, as shown in figure 3.

Many runtime permissions access private user data, a special type of restricted data that includes potentially sensitive information. Examples of private user data include location and contact information.

The microphone and camera provide access to particularly sensitive information. Therefore, the system helps you explain why your app accesses this information.

The system assigns the dangerous protection level to runtime permissions.

## Special Permissions
Special permissions correspond to particular app operations. Only the platform and OEMs can define special permissions. Additionally, the platform and OEMs usually define special permissions when they want to protect access to particularly powerful actions, such as drawing over other apps.

The Special app access page in system settings contains a set of user-toggleable operations. Many of these operations are implemented as special permissions.

Each special permission has its own implementation details. The instructions for using each special permission appear on the permissions API reference page. The system assigns the appop protection level to special permissions.

## Permission Groups

Permissions can belong to permission groups. Permission groups consist of a set of logically related permissions. For example, permissions to send and receive SMS messages might belong to the same group, as they both relate to the application's interaction with SMS.

Permission groups help the system minimize the number of system dialogs that are presented to the user when an app requests closely related permissions. When a user is presented with a prompt to grant permissions for an application, permissions belonging to the same group are presented in the same interface. However, permissions can change groups without notice, so don't assume that a particular permission is grouped with any other permission.
